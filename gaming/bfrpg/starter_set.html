	<h1>Starter Set</h1>
		<p>I made some BFRPG (<a href="http://www.basicfantasy.org">Basic Fantasy Role-Playing Game</a>) &quot;cards&quot; for a friend of mine. He expressed interest in my tabletop RPG game, but he lives several hours away, and his infrequent visits are consumed (and rightly so!) by family activities. I gave him the BFRPG core rulebook, but I know from experience how opaque a core rulebook can be to the uninitiated. I wanted to send him something to get him started on his own. My wife had been telling me about this &quot;Happy Mail&quot; trend&emdash;sending hand-crafted, hand-written letters and notes&emdash;and I thought: Perfect! RPG Happy Mail!</p>
	<h2>Cards at the Table</h2>
		<p>Here are the finished cards, laminated and staged for play. I should note that while I&#039;ve been a minor contributor to the BFRPG project, I benefit in no way from it. Nor does anyone. It&#039;s a not-for-profit endeavor; the creator sells the books at cost. Seriously, they&#039;re cheap. Look them up <a href="http://amzn.com/1503334945">on Amazon</a>.</p>

	<h2>Graph Paper Index Cards</h2>
		<p>I&#039;d had the happy mail idea for idea for a few weeks before I saw these babies in Staples. Best buck-ninety-nine I ever spent.</p>

	<h2>NPC Card: Osric the Barkeep</h2>
		<p>Each card is a combination of sharpie and magic marker. All the lettering is done by hand. In a lot of ways, I&#039;m not terribly happy with these; I could have done a lot better laying them out on a PC. In fact, I think I&#039;d like to do more of these electronically. But I will admit it felt good to do something like this totally by hand. It took me back to middle school.</p>

	<h2>Map Card: Inn</h2>
		<p>I did not include a map key. I tried to draw well enough to get the point across. Part of the point of this was to get my friend playing with minimal reading and table-consulting.</p>
		<img src="http://i.imgur.com/448Lvyc.png" />
	<h2>Map Card: Cellar</h2>
		<p>Again, no key. I hope the bins of fruits and vegetables are obvious, as well as the brewing kegs. The maps were the most fun to draw.</p>

	<h2>PC Card: Fighter</h2>
		<p>I gave each player character the same ability spread: 18, 16, 14, 11, 11, 8. Results in a pretty beefy net +5 character. I also went easy and maxed out each PC&#039;s first hit die. I know, I know, but I figure the players will be first timers....</p>
		<p><strong>Errata:</strong> I forgot to take the fighter's attack bonus into account. It should say: "Longsword: +4, 1d8+3"</p>

	<h2>PC Card: Cleric</h2>
		<p>For each character, I made sure the picture matched the weapon and armor. Again, keeping things really easy for first time players.</p>
		<p><strong>Errata:</strong> The Cleric's DEX modifier should be -1, not +1.</p>

	<h2>PC Card: Thief</h2>
		<p>I also tried to highlight each character&#039;s best and worst ability in their description. I&#039;m hoping it&#039;s specific enough to spur some role play, but general enough that players can take it almost anywhere.</p>

	<h2>Monster Card: Rat Swarm</h2>
		<p>Even though I beefed up the PCs... this guy does a d6 damage. A couple of lucky dice rolls by the Dungeon Master, and, boom, PC down.</p>
		<img src="http://i.imgur.com/MJE5nBH.png" />
	<h2>Monster Card: Giant Rat</h2>
		<p>I play-tested these with my wife and 4-year-old daughter... the Giant Rat was a WAY easier fight than I figured.</p>

	<h2>Letter</h2>
		<p>My wife bought me some faux parchment paper some years back; I hate the way it feels (like really lightweight printer paper), but I LOVE the way it looks. The page numbers work for BFRPG 2nd and 3rd edition (editions are more like &quot;revisions&quot; in BFRPG).</p>

	<h2>Envelope</h2>
		<p>I love my wife; she custom made this envelope for me out of a piece of leather-textured scrapbooking paper. I printed the address in the &quot;Lucinda Calligraphy&quot; font and used a light table to trace it onto the envelope with a brush-tipped sharpie. The effect was great in person, and the thick envelope with the laminated cards and letter had great heft!</p>

	<h2>Back of the Envelope</h2>
		<p>I drew this at the last second on a whim. I shudder that the hilt and the blade don&#039;t line up... amateur hour. But I did want to show the back of the envelope because it shows off the great paper.</p>
